# Comet Generator

Forget the boring setup. Comet gets your new project ready to go by asking a few simple questions. It handles all the annoying first steps: making the project folder, firing up a new git repo, and grabbing your dependencies with bun.

## Quick Start

Create a new project with a single command. For the fastest experience, we highly recommend using **Bun**.

```bash
# Using Bun (Recommended & Fastest)
bun create comet@latest

# Using pnpm
pnpm create comet@latest

# Using npm
npx create-comet@latest # absolute incels will use use this
```

## Prerequisites

The commands above require **Bun** or **pnpm** to be installed. If you don't have them yet, you can add them with the following commands.

### Install Bun

```bash
npm install -g bun # The last npm command you'll ever need
```

### Install pnpm

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@latest-10
```
